      <dt>Creeper</dt>
      <dd>
        A creeper is a common hostile mob that quietly approaches players and
        then explodes, which can destroy blocks and deal massive amounts of
        damage. Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well as the only way
        to obtain most music discs.
      </dd>
      <dt>Enderman</dt>
      <dd>
        An enderman is a tall neutral mob found in all three dimensions. It
        becomes hostile to players that damage it or look directly at its face,
        using its arms to attack. Endermen teleport erratically, as well as away
        from dangers such as lava, projectiles, and water. They also
        occasionally pick up and move certain blocks.
